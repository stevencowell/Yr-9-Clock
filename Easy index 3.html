<details>
<summary><strong>Week 6:</strong> Timber Seasoning &amp; Complete Carcass Assembly</summary>
<p><strong>Content:</strong> Learn about timber seasoning (drying processes) through a brief documentary or presentation. Finish assembling the carcass by ensuring all parts are flush and attaching the clock face mechanism backing.</p>
<p><strong>Theory:</strong> Timber conversion and seasoning methods: compare air-drying vs kiln-drying and their pros/cons. Discuss how properly seasoned wood prevents issues like warping. Consider historical timber technologies (how wood was worked/dried in the past) for context. Introduce the concept of a hidden drawer design (planning how it will function).</p>
<p><strong>Practical:</strong> Once glue has fully cured on the carcass, plane or sand the assembled clock to ensure all faces are flat and joints are smooth. Mark out the section of the clock body that will become the secret drawer (but do not cut yet). Possibly attach the clock face mount or ensure the drilled hole is ready for the clock insert.</p>
<p><strong>Resources:</strong> Timber Seasoning Video, Google Classroom – Week 6.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Week 7: Cut Secret Drawer &amp; Sustainability in Timber</strong></summary>
<p><strong>Content:</strong> Create the secret drawer compartment: cut out the drawer opening from the clock body and cut timber pieces for the drawer itself. Focus on sustainable practices in woodworking and the timber industry.</p>
<p><strong>Theory:</strong> Renewable vs non-renewable timber resources. Examples of recycling and reusing timber (e.g., old barn wood, plantation timbers). Environmental sustainability issues in the timber industry and how they are addressed (like plantation forestry and certified sustainable wood). Connect how making efficient use of materials (and even incorporating a small drawer) relates to reducing waste.</p>
<p><strong>Practical:</strong> Carefully cut into the clock body to remove the section for the secret drawer (using a drill and coping saw or hand saw/chisel as needed). Cut and plane the small pieces that will form the drawer box. Also, use a router or rasp to put a 6mm chamfer around the inside edge of the clock face hole if a beveled edge is desired for the clock insert. Begin assembling the drawer, but leave final fitting for next week.</p>
<p><strong>Resources:</strong> Sustainability in Timber (article), Google Classroom – Week 7.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Week 8: Materials Cutting List &amp; Costing in Excel</strong></summary>
<p><strong>Content:</strong> Shift focus to documentation: compile a cutting list of all parts of the clock with dimensions, and use a spreadsheet to calculate materials used and their costs. Ensure any remaining construction tasks are minimal to allow for this theory/application work.</p>
<p><strong>Theory:</strong> The purpose of a cutting list in project planning. Basic budgeting for a project: calculating the cost of timber and hardware used. Using spreadsheet formulas to sum quantities and costs. Discussion of efficient material usage to minimise waste and cost (reinforcing sustainability).</p>
<p><strong>Practical:</strong> In a computer lab or using personal devices, students input their clock’s parts into a simple spreadsheet (part name, dimensions, quantity, unit price) to practise calculating total material requirements and cost. Double-cheque the accuracy of their lists against the actual project. Any spare time can be used to finish sanding or minor construction tweaks on the clock.</p>
<p><strong>Resources:</strong> Spreadsheet Template (Cutting List &amp; Costing), Google Classroom – Week 8.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Week 9:</strong> Assemble &amp; Fit Drawer; Reflect on Timber Choice</summary>
<p><strong>Content:</strong> Final assembly of the secret drawer and fitting it to the clock. Engage in a class exercise evaluating different timber options and how their properties would affect the project (reinforcing timber theory).</p>
<p><strong>Theory:</strong> Analyse how the properties of the chosen timber (e.g., pine or other) influenced the building process and outcome. Consider alternative timbers: how would a hardwood vs a softwood perform for this project (durability, workability, appearance)? Discuss improvements: what could be done differently to improve the project if it were built again.</p>
<p><strong>Practical:</strong> Assemble the drawer using glue (and small nails or screws if needed for strength). Plane and sand the drawer so it slides smoothly into the clock’s cavity. Make fine adjustments to the opening or drawer size as necessary for a good fit. Ensure the drawer face sits flush and is discreet. If hardware like a tiny handle or magnet catch is used, install it.</p>

</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Week 10:</strong> Workshop Maintenance &amp; Clean-Up</summary>
<p><strong>Content:</strong> Dedicate time to comprehensive workshop maintenance. This includes cleaning workstations, organising tools, and safe storage of materials after the major construction phase. Emphasise how a clean, well-maintained workshop improves safety and project quality.</p>
<p><strong>Theory:</strong> Safe workshop practices revisited: proper lifting techniques (to move timber or equipment), keeping walkways free of trip hazards, and collaboratively maintaining a tidy work environment. Discuss the impact of tool maintenance (sharp tools, oiled machines) on both safety and the quality of workmanship.</p>
<p><strong>Practical:</strong> All students participate in cleanup: sweep floors, vacuum sawdust, return all tools to their proper storage, and report any damaged tools or dull blades for fixing. Conduct basic tool maintenance as a class (e.g., oiling metal tool parts to prevent rust, sharpening a chisel as a demonstration). By the end, the workshop should be reset for finishing tasks in coming weeks.</p>

</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Week 11:</strong> Safe Work Method Statement (SWMS)</summary>
<p><strong>Content:</strong> Complete a Safe Work Method Statement for the clock project. This formal document will list each step of the project alongside potential hazards and the measures taken to control risks. Ensure all students have documented the sequence of construction in their folio.</p>
<p><strong>Theory:</strong> Risk management principles: the hierarchy of hazard control (eliminate, substitute, engineering controls, administrative controls, PPE). How planning and foresight improve safety. The role of SWMS in industry and how it applies to our project (ensuring any use of machines, e.g., drill press, had documented safety measures).</p>
<p><strong>Practical:</strong> Students fill out or finalise their SWMS forms, identifying hazards they encountered (e.g., cutting with a saw, drilling, sanding) and writing down how they mitigated those risks (e.g., wearing safety glasses, using clamps, teacher supervision for certain tasks). Also, do a quick run-through of the project plan from start to finish and cheque if every step is accounted for and completed. This is also a chance to ensure their project folio is up to date with all required components (design sketches, cutting list, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>Resources:</strong> SWMS Template &amp; Example, Google Classroom – Week 11.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Week 12:</strong> Sanding &amp; Surface Prep for Finishing</summary>
<p><strong>Content:</strong> Prepare the fully constructed clock for finishing. This involves thorough sanding of all surfaces (including the drawer and any edges) to achieve a smooth surface free of pencil marks, dents, or rough grain. Ensure the clock is clean and ready for applying a finish.</p>
<p><strong>Theory:</strong> Reasons for surface preparation: a smooth surface ensures a better appearance and adhesion of finishes. Recap grit sizes for sandpaper and their uses (coarse vs fine). Emphasise sanding with the grain to avoid scratches. Briefly discuss why we apply finishes to timber (protection from moisture, enhanced appearance).</p>
<p><strong>Practical:</strong> Start with medium-grit sandpaper and work through to fine grit on the entire clock and drawer. Use sanding blocks or orbital sanders where appropriate, but finish by hand to feel the smoothness. Students should frequently cheque that all sharp edges are slightly eased (for safety and a professional look). After sanding, have students remove all dust from their clock (using a brush or damp rag) in preparation for oiling next week.</p>
<p><strong>Resources:</strong> Sanding Technique Video, Google Classroom – Week 12.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Week 13:</strong> Oil Finish Application &amp; Self-Evaluation</summary>
<p><strong>Content:</strong> Apply a clear oil finish (e.g., Danish oil) to the clock project to protect the wood and bring out the grain. While the oil is drying between coats, begin a written self-evaluation of the project in the folio, reflecting on the process and outcome.</p>
<p><strong>Theory:</strong> Overview of different timber finishes: oils (like Danish or linseed oil) versus varnishes, shellac, paint, etc., and where each is used. Focus on oil finishes as a simple, food-safe option that enhances natural look. Application techniques (rag vs brush) and safety precautions (proper ventilation, disposing of oily rags to prevent spontaneous combustion). Importance of self-evaluation in technology projects: understanding what went well, what challenges arose, and how problems were solved, to improve future work.</p>
<p><strong>Practical:</strong> Students apply the first coat of oil finish to their clock and drawer – using a clean cloth to wipe on the oil along the grain. After allowing proper penetration time, wipe off excess to avoid stickiness. Set pieces aside to dry. During drying time, students work on their self-evaluation worksheets or folio entries, answering questions about their project (e.g., How closely did your final product meet your initial design? What would you do differently next time?). If time permits and oil is dry to touch, a second coat of oil can be applied for a richer finish.</p>

</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Week 14:</strong> Theory Test &amp; Unit Feedback</summary>
<p><strong>Content:</strong> A short theory test is administered covering key knowledge from the term (safety, tools, timber theory, processes). After the test, engage in class discussion and feedback. Students receive feedback on their projects and have an opportunity to give feedback on the unit.</p>
<p><strong>Theory:</strong> The test will assess understanding of workshop safety rules, tool usage, timber properties, joinery, and finishing – essentially the theory topics learned throughout the Breadboard and Clock units. Post-test, discuss any challenging questions to clarify misconceptions. Emphasise the learning value of mistakes and correct answers. Additionally, discuss as a group what aspects of the project unit were most successful and what could be improved, both from the student perspective and for future classes.</p>
<p><strong>Practical:</strong> (No practical work this week due to the theory assessment.) After the test, ensure all students have completed their folios and have prepared their projects for submission. This time can also be used for final touch-ups if absolutely needed or to quietly review feedback individually with students about their project craftsmanship and adherence to the brief.</p>
<p><strong>Resources:</strong> Revision Materials, Student Feedback Form, Google Classroom – Week 14.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Week 15:</strong> Project Hand-In &amp; Wrap-Up</summary>
<p><strong>Content:</strong> Finalise everything. Students submit their completed clock project and the accompanying workbook/folio for marking. Conclude the unit with a summary of what was learned and celebrate the students’ achievements.</p>
<p><strong>Theory:</strong> (No new theory – this week focuses on concluding the unit.) Review the overall outcomes: Students can identify how they applied design principles, safe practices, and technical skills to create a quality project. Highlight the real-world connections of these skills and knowledge. Optionally, have a brief discussion on how these skills might be used in future projects or careers in design and technology.</p>
<p><strong>Practical:</strong> Ensure each student properly labels their project and compiles all parts of their folio (design sketches, cutting list, SWMS, evaluation, etc.) for submission. The teacher may conduct a final inspection of each clock with the student, noting any creative features or well-done aspects, and any areas of difficulty. This can be a moment of informal presentation where students show their clock to peers and talk about something they learned. Finally, the class helps with any final clean-up and storage of projects awaiting marking.</p>

<p>Always be safe when working with wood. Wear safety glasses and sturdy closed shoes. Keep the workshop tidy and put away pencils and tools after use. This keeps everyone safe and prevents trips or spills.</p>
<h4>Measuring wood</h4>
<p>We use a pencil and straight tools to mark wood before cutting. First, mark a “face” side and edge on your wood so all measurements start from the same spot. Remember: <strong>measure twice, cut once</strong>. This means check your measurement carefully before you cut. When you saw, cut on the waste side of the line (the part you don’t need) so the piece stays the right size.</p>

<summary><strong>Week 2:</strong> Wood types and drilling holes</summary>
<article>
<h4>Hard and soft wood</h4>
<p>Wood can come from many trees. Hardwoods (like oak or mahogany) are strong and heavy. Softwoods (like pine or cedar) grow fast and are easier to cut. For example, pine is a softwood and is lighter and easier to saw than oak.</p>
<h4>Drilling holes</h4>
<p>We use a drill press to make the big round hole for the clock face. The drill spins a bit (called a Forstner bit) very fast through the wood. Always clamp the wood down, keep fingers away, and wear safety glasses when drilling.</p>

<summary><strong>Week 3:</strong> Tree rings and drawings</summary>
<article>
<h4>Wood grain</h4>
<p>Wood comes from trees. You can see rings in a tree cross-section; each ring is one year of growth. Knots are dark spots where branches grew. These patterns (grain) can make wood pretty but also affect how easy it is to cut.</p>
<h4>Drawing our plan</h4>
<p>Before building, we make drawings of our clock. Drawing (sketching) helps us see the shape and size of pieces. We use rulers and triangles to draw straight lines. This way we know what to build before we start cutting.</p>

<summary><strong>Week 4:</strong> Putting pieces together</summary>
<article>
<h4>Joining wood pieces</h4>
<p>This week we put the clock sides, front, and back together. We cut slots (rebates) inside the body so the bottom and top fit in neatly. We used glue and clamps to hold everything square and tight. Taking time to align the pieces means the clock stands straight.</p>
<h4>Tools and safety</h4>
<p>We keep our tools sharp and clean so cuts are smooth and safe. After using a tool, we unplug or turn it off. Always check your saw and chisel are sharp so they do not slip. By taking care of our tools, we stay safe and the work looks better.</p>

<summary><strong>Week 5:</strong> Smoothing edges and gluing</summary>
<article>
<h4>Smoothing edges</h4>
<p>We plane the top and bottom edges of the clock parts at a 45° angle, making a chamfer. This means the edges are slanted and smooth. A slanted edge looks nice and feels smooth. We always plane with the grain of the wood to avoid rough spots.</p>
<h4>Gluing the clock body</h4>
<p>Now we dry-fit all pieces and apply wood glue along the edges. We put glue between each joint and clamp the pieces together. We check that everything is lined up before the glue dries. Once clamped, we let the glue harden so the clock becomes one strong piece.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>We made the edges smooth (chamfered) and glued all pieces to form the clock body. Planing created nice angles and gluing with clamps made the body solid. Checking that everything lines up before it dries helped us build a good strong clock body.</p>

<summary><strong>Week 6:</strong> Drying wood and building</summary>
<article>
<h4>Drying wood</h4>
<p>Wood that is green (wet) can warp or twist as it dries. We learned about seasoning: air-drying outside or kiln-drying in a heated room. Dry wood is more stable and less likely to bend or crack later. Properly dried wood means our clock stays nice and straight.</p>
<h4>Finishing assembly</h4>
<p>After the glue dried, we removed clamps and checked the clock body. We sanded any rough edges so everything is smooth. We also made sure the hole for the clock face is nice and clean and attached the wood piece for the clock mechanism.</p>

<summary><strong>Week 7:</strong> The secret drawer</summary>
<article>
<h4>Making the drawer</h4>
<p>This week we make the secret drawer for the clock. We carefully cut out a slot in the body where the drawer will go. Then we cut and assemble the small wood pieces to form the drawer box and slide it in. We sand the drawer sides so it slides smoothly in and out of the clock.</p>
<h4>Using wood wisely</h4>
<p>We learned that wood comes from trees, which take a long time to grow. We try to use every bit of wood and recycle scraps. For example, if a piece of wood has a bad knot, we can use the good parts and not waste it. By using wood carefully, we help nature and save money.</p>

<summary><strong>Week 8:</strong> Wood list and cost</summary>
<article>
<h4>List of parts</h4>
<p>This week we made a list of every piece of wood we need. We wrote down each part name, its length, width, and thickness. This cutting list shows exactly how many of each piece to cut. It helps us make sure we have all the pieces for the clock.</p>
<h4>Counting cost</h4>
<p>We also made a table with each piece’s price. We multiplied the length of wood by its price per length to find the cost. Then we added up the costs to see the total. Knowing the cost helps us learn how much money is needed and to use wood wisely.</p>

<summary><strong>Week 9:</strong> Finish drawer and think about wood</summary>
<article>
<h4>Finishing the drawer</h4>
<p>We glued and finished assembling the drawer box this week. We sanded it so it fit nicely in the clock and slides easily. We made sure the drawer face is level with the clock body and is easy to open and close.</p>
<h4>Thinking about wood choices</h4>
<p>We talked about the wood we used for the clock (like pine). Pine is easy to cut and cheap. We compared it to hardwood (like oak), which is stronger but heavier and more expensive. We discussed what we might do differently next time to make the clock better.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>The drawer now fits well and the wood of our clock (pine) was easy to use. We discussed that oak is stronger but costs more. Next time we could try a different design or wood for practice. Thinking about choices helps us make better decisions.</p>

<summary><strong>Week 10:</strong> Cleaning the workshop</summary>
<article>
<h4>Workshop cleaning</h4>
<p>We spent the class time cleaning the workshop. We swept the floor, wiped tables, and organized the tools. A clean workshop keeps everyone safe and makes it easier to work. Remember to put materials back and clear the benches when finished.</p>
<h4>Taking care of tools</h4>
<p>We also checked our tools. If a tool is dull, we sharpen it with a file or hone. We oil metal parts so they don’t rust. Keeping tools in good shape helps them work better and last longer.</p>

<summary><strong>Week 11:</strong> Planning for safety</summary>
<article>
<h4>Writing a safety plan</h4>
<p>We learned to list each step of our project and think about what could go wrong. This list is called a safety plan. For example, if we are cutting wood, a hazard is splinters or machine accidents. We then write how to stay safe: wear gloves and glasses, clamp the wood, and keep hands away from blades.</p>
<h4>How to stay safe</h4>
<p>We also talked about the order of doing things safely. First do the dangerous step (like cutting) with teacher help, then clean up. If something unsafe might happen, we either change how to do it or wear more protection (like ear plugs or a mask). It is like a rulebook for staying safe!</p>

<summary><strong>Week 12:</strong> Sanding wood</summary>
<article>
<h4>Sanding and smooth</h4>
<p>We started sanding the clock wood this week. Sandpaper comes in rough, medium, and fine grit. We began with rough grit to remove big bumps, then used finer grits to make it very smooth. Sanding always goes with the wood grain to avoid scratches.</p>
<h4>Getting ready for finish</h4>
<p>After sanding, we cleaned off all dust. A clean, smooth surface is important so the finish will look nice. Our wood is now ready for the oil finish next week.</p>

<summary><strong>Week 13:</strong> Oiling wood and talking</summary>
<article>
<h4>Applying the oil finish</h4>
<p>We apply a clear oil finish to the wood. Oil soaks into the wood to protect it and make the color stand out. We use a clean rag to wipe the oil on along the grain. After it dries, we wipe off the extra oil. We may do more than one coat for a richer look.</p>
<h4>Talking about our project</h4>
<p>While the oil dries, we start talking about our project. We discuss what we liked and what we found hard. We answer questions: did our clock match our design? What would we do differently? This is called self-evaluation and helps us learn for next time.</p>

<summary><strong>Week 15:</strong> Show project and celebrate</summary>
<article>
<h4>Project presentations</h4>
<p>We take turns to show our finished clocks to the class. Each student talks about their design and what they learned. It's like a show and tell: we see different styles of clocks and learn from each other’s work.</p>
<h4>Final wrap-up</h4>
<p>Finally, we clean up the workshop one last time and celebrate finishing our projects. We talk about all the new skills we learned: being safe, using tools, and making something from wood. This is the big finish of our clock project!</p>
