<summary><strong>Week 2: Timber Types &amp; Drilling Techniques</strong></summary>
<article>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Week 2 dives into preparing the clock’s side pieces and creating the opening for the clock face. Alongside the practical work, we explored the differences between hardwoods and softwoods – an important consideration when choosing materials for any project. We also introduced a new tool in our construction: the drill press with a Forstner bit, perfect for cutting clean, large holes.</p>

<h4>Hardwoods vs Softwoods</h4>
<p>Woods are broadly categorised into <strong>hardwoods</strong> and <strong>softwoods</strong>, but the naming can be misleading. Hardwoods come from deciduous trees (like oak, maple, mahogany) and often have denser wood and attractive grain patterns. Softwoods come from coniferous trees (like pine, cedar, spruce) and usually grow faster, often making them less dense. For example, pine (a common softwood) is typically lighter and easier to cut, whereas oak (a hardwood) is heavier and can be more challenging to saw or nail.</p>
<p>In our project, we likely use a softwood (such as pine) due to its availability and ease of use for beginners. It’s important to know that <strong>softwoods are not always “soft”</strong> – some softwoods (like Douglas fir or yew) can be quite hard. Similarly, hardwoods aren’t always extremely hard (balsa wood is a hardwood but one of the softest woods). The key differences lie in their structure: hardwoods have pores (vessels) in their grain, softwoods do not, and instead may have resin canals.</p>
<p>Understanding these differences matters because it affects workability and suitable use. Hardwoods are often chosen for fine furniture or projects needing durability and wear resistance. Softwoods are commonly used in construction and projects where large pieces are needed cost-effectively. In our clock, either type could be used, but a softwood like pine is sufficient and more user-friendly for cutting and joining. If you’re curious for more detail on how hardwoods and softwoods compare in density, grain, and uses, the following resource is helpful.</p>
<h4>Additional Resource: Wood Characteristics</h4>
<p>For a deeper comparison of hardwoods vs. softwoods, including examples and typical uses, cheque out <a href="https://hi-spec.com/blogs/news/wood-characteristics-a-guide-to-hardwoods-vs-softwoods" style="color: blue;" target="_blank">this guide to wood characteristics</a>. It explains why certain woods are chosen for specific projects (for instance, why builders use pine for framing houses but oak for a tabletop).</p>
<h4>Drilling the Clock Face Opening</h4>
<p>This week you saw the <strong>drill press</strong> in action with a <strong>Forstner bit</strong>. A Forstner bit is a drill bit that cuts clean, flat-bottomed holes. It was the ideal choice to create the round hole in the front panel for our clock face insert. We learned the setup: secure the front panel on the drill press table with a clamp, choose the correct diameter Forstner bit (slightly larger than the clock mechanism or insert diameter to allow a fit), and drill at a slow, steady feed. Safety points include always using a clamp (never hand-hold work on a drill press) and wearing safety glasses because the bit produces a lot of shavings quickly.</p>
<p>We also discussed “step drilling” – if you ever need to drill an extra large hole but don’t have one big bit, you can drill a smaller pilot hole first or work up in bit sizes. However, in our case, we had the right tool for the job. You probably noticed how the Forstner bit’s centre point keeps it steady while the sharp rim scores the circle; this design is what gives such a neat cut without tear-out if used properly.</p>
<h4>Joinery Planning &amp; Grain Direction</h4>
<p>While working on the side panels, we’ve started to think about how everything will join together. The term <strong>“rebate” joint</strong> came up – this is a type of joint where a groove or notch (a rebate) is cut at the edge of one piece so another piece can fit into it. We haven’t cut rebates yet (that’s coming soon), but planning for them matters now. For instance, if the sides of the clock will eventually get a rebate to accept the back panel, we must ensure our side panels have enough thickness and aren’t tapered off by over-planing edges.</p>
<p>Another concept is <strong>grain direction</strong>. When you were planing the long edges of your side panels to smooth them, you might have noticed planing “against the grain” caused tear-out (little splinters lifting up). The solution was to plane “with the grain” – that is, in the direction that the wood fibers lie down. This same idea will apply later when we cut joints or chamfers; paying attention to grain can mean the difference between a clean cut and a rough one. Additionally, grain direction affects strength: wood is generally strongest along the grain. We will see this when we consider how to orient pieces for the best strength (for example, the clock’s top and bottom pieces should have grain running along their length for strength).</p>
<h4>Discussion Questions</h4>
<ol>
<li>Pine is a softwood and oak is a hardwood. Based on what you learned, which would be easier to saw by hand and why?</li>
<li>What tool did we use to drill the large hole for the clock face, and what makes that tool suitable for this task?</li>
<li>When using the drill press, why is it important to clamp down your workpiece rather than holding it with your hand?</li>
</ol>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Week 2 equipped you with essential knowledge about timber selection and introduced you to using the drill press for precision tasks. You’ve successfully prepared the fundamental pieces of your clock (front, back, and sides) and created a perfect circular opening for the clock face. Understanding wood types will help you appreciate why we use certain materials, and the practical drilling skills you learned will be invaluable for any project requiring clean holes. Next week, we’ll build on this by examining wood properties more closely and developing the drawings and plans for the clock.</p>
