<summary><strong>Week 7:</strong> Cut Secret Drawer &amp; Sustainability in Timber</summary>
<article>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Welcome to Week 7 of the Clock project. This week we pause from major construction to focus on sustainability and the environment. As you begin creating the clock’s <em>secret drawer</em> compartment, we’ll explore where timber comes from and how our choices in materials and design can impact the world around us. Understanding concepts like renewable resources, plantation timber, and recycling will help you become a more responsible designer and builder.</p>

<h4>Renewable vs Non-Renewable Resources</h4>
<p><strong>Timber is a renewable resource</strong> – it comes from trees that can be replanted and grown again. This is different from <strong>non-renewable resources</strong> like coal or oil (which can’t be replaced once used) or even metals (which are finite in the ground). When forests are managed properly, new trees are planted to replace those harvested, ensuring we don’t run out of wood. Using timber from well-managed forests means we’re using a material that can keep regenerating, rather than depleting something forever. In contrast, if we cut trees faster than they regrow or clear forests without replanting, even wood could become a non-renewable resource in practise. The key is responsible management so that timber remains a resource future generations can also use.</p>
<h4>Plantation Timber and Sustainable Forestry</h4>
<p>One way the timber industry addresses sustainability is through <strong>plantation forests</strong>. Plantation timber comes from trees that are specifically planted, grown, and harvested like a crop. In Australia, for example, many construction timbers (such as certain pines) are grown in plantations. These plantations take pressure off natural native forests because we can get the wood we need without heavily logging wild habitats. Sustainable forestry practices involve long-term planning: for every tree cut down, many new ones are planted in its place. Forestry companies and governments also enforce regulations – like cutting only mature trees and protecting areas with high conservation value – to balance timber production with ecosystem health. You might have seen logos like <strong>FSC® or PEFC</strong> on wood products; these are certifications indicating the wood was sourced from forests that meet strict environmental and ethical standards. Choosing certified sustainable timber means the wood has been tracked from a responsibly managed forest, so you know your material wasn’t sourced by harming the environment or violating laws.</p>
<h4>Recycling and Reusing Timber</h4>
<p>Another big part of timber sustainability is <strong>recycling and reusing wood</strong>. Timber is a material that often can have a second life. Instead of throwing away offcuts or old wood furniture, we can repurpose that wood for new projects. For instance, wood from a broken piece of furniture or old building beams can be cleaned up and used again in a new design (you might have heard of people using reclaimed barn wood for flooring or furniture – that’s recycling timber). By reusing wood, we reduce the demand to cut down new trees and also keep usable material out of landfills. Even scraps and sawdust from workshops can be recycled – they can be made into things like particle board or used as biomass fuel. In our own project, think about the timber pieces you’ve cut: how can we make the most of them? One example is the <em>secret drawer</em> you’re creating. The section of wood you remove from the clock body to make space for the drawer doesn’t go to waste – it becomes part of the drawer itself. By incorporating a small drawer (made from offcuts of our main project timber), we’re practicing efficient use of materials and reducing waste. This kind of thoughtful design – where even the “scrap” piece is turned into a functional part – is an excellent example of sustainability in woodworking.</p>
<h4>Additional Resource: Sustainable Timber in Australia</h4>
<p>For more on how timber can be used responsibly, cheque out Planet Ark’s <a href="https://planetark.org/programs/make-it-wood" style="color: blue;" target="_blank">Make It Wood</a> initiative. It explains why using <strong>responsibly sourced wood</strong> is beneficial for the environment (wood is renewable, stores carbon, and uses less energy to produce than many other materials) and why protecting high conservation forests is so important. It’s a great read to understand Australia’s approach to sustainable timber.</p>
<h4>Discussion Questions</h4>
<ol>
<li>What does it mean for a timber resource to be “sustainably managed,” and why is this important?</li>
<li>How can a consumer or woodworker know if the timber they are using comes from sustainable sources?</li>
<li>In our clock project, how does adding a small drawer made from leftover wood help reduce waste?</li>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>This week, you learned that being a skilled woodworker isn’t just about cutting and joining wood – it’s also about understanding where your materials come from and how to use them responsibly. Timber can be an eco-friendly resource when managed well, and even our project design can reduce waste (as seen with our secret drawer). Keep these sustainability principles in mind moving forward. Next week, we’ll switch gears from woodworking theory to some practical math and planning: you’ll compile a cutting list for your clock and calculate the project’s cost using a spreadsheet.</p>
