<summary><strong>Week 8:</strong> Materials Cutting List &amp; Costing in Excel</summary>
<article>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>In Week 8, we move from the workshop into a bit of <em>office work</em> – but it’s all part of completing a successful project. Now that most of the clock’s construction is underway, it’s time to document exactly what materials we have used (and still need) and how much they cost. This week focuses on creating a <strong>cutting list</strong> and using a spreadsheet (like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets) to calculate material quantities and costs. These skills are important for project planning: they help ensure you have enough of each part, avoid unexpected expenses, and minimise wasted material. Think of it as the planning and budgeting phase for your clock project.</p>
<h4>Preparing a Cutting List</h4>
<p>A <strong>cutting list</strong> (or materials list) is a detailed list of every part required for your project, including the dimensions and quantity of each piece. Making a cutting list is one of the first steps professionals take before cutting timber, and we’re doing it now to practise good planning. To create a cutting list for your clock, go through your design and identify all the pieces – for example: front panel, back panel, side panels, top and bottom pieces, the drawer parts, etc. For each part, note its length, width, and thickness (in millimeters) and how many of that part you need. It’s useful to organise this information in a table format. Your cutting list might have columns for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Part Name:</strong> e.g., “Front Panel”, “Side Panel”.</li>
<li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> the size of the part (length × width × thickness in mm).</li>
<li><strong>Quantity:</strong> how many of that part are needed.</li>
<li><strong>Material/Notes:</strong> (optional) type of wood or any notes (for instance, if a piece will be cut from another piece).</li>
</ul>
<p>By listing all this out, you have a clear blueprint for what needs to be cut. A good cutting list helps you plan your cuts efficiently – you can figure out how to lay out parts on your timber boards so that you minimise waste. It also serves as a checklist so you don’t accidentally forget a piece (avoiding that “uh-oh, I need another strip of wood” moment later!). Take your time to make the list accurate. If you have the original design drawings or plans, use them to ensure you get every part’s dimensions correct.</p>
<h4>Using Spreadsheets for Costing</h4>
<p>Once you have the list of parts, the next step is to calculate how much material you need in total and how much it will cost. This is where a spreadsheet is really handy. Spreadsheets like Excel or Google Sheets allow you to set up a table and use formulas to do the math for you. For our project, you can create columns such as <strong>Quantity</strong>, <strong>Unit Price</strong>, and <strong>Total Cost</strong> for each part. Here’s how it typically works:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, find out the <strong>unit price</strong> of your material. For example, if you’re using pine, maybe it costs a certain amount per meter or per length for a given cross-section. Likewise, include unit prices for any hardware (like the clock mechanism or screws) or finishing materials if needed.</li>
<li>In the spreadsheet, enter the quantity of each part and the unit price. Then use a formula to calculate <strong>Total Cost</strong> for that line (usually Quantity × Unit Price). For instance, if you need 2 pieces of wood and each costs $3, the total for that part is =2*3 (which the spreadsheet will calculate as $6).</li>
<li>After doing this for all parts (and hardware), use a <strong>SUM</strong> formula to add up all the individual costs. This gives you the <strong>overall cost</strong> of materials for your clock project.</li>
</ul>
<p>The great thing about a spreadsheet is that if you change a number (say you decide to make the clock bigger and now need longer pieces), it will recalculate the costs automatically. It helps prevent arithmetic mistakes – no one wants to add up 15 items by hand repeatedly. You’ll also get practise with basic spreadsheet skills: entering data, using formulas (like =SUM or simple multiplication), and formatting cells. These are useful skills not just in tech class but in many real-world scenarios.</p>
<h4>Efficient Planning and Budgeting</h4>
<p>Making a cutting list and budget isn’t just busywork – it’s a chance to think critically about your project. By seeing all your parts listed, you might spot ways to use materials more efficiently. For example, you could notice that two small parts could be cut from one larger offcut piece. This kind of planning can save material and money. Also, when you calculate the total cost, you might be surprised at how costs add up (timber + clock mechanism + glue + finish, etc.). If the project were over a budget, a designer could decide to change something – perhaps use a different wood or simplify the design to require less material. In our case, it’s good to know how much your clock would cost to build, as it mirrors what happens in industry: before building something, companies always estimate material costs and adjust the plan if needed to stay on budget.</p>
<h4>Additional Resource: Cutting List Template</h4>
<p>To help you get started, a sample spreadsheet template for the cutting list and costing exercise is provided via Google Classroom (Week 8 resources). Open the template and fill in your own project’s details – part names, dimensions, quantities, and prices – just like we discussed. The template already has the necessary formulas set up, so it will automatically total your costs. Using the template will let you practise without worrying about setting up the spreadsheet from scratch.</p>
<h4>Discussion Questions</h4>
<ol>
<li>Why is it useful to create a cutting list before you start cutting materials for a project?</li>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>By the end of this week, you’ve switched hats from being a craftsman on the tools to being a planner and accountant for your project. You created a cutting list that brings clarity to what you’re building, and you used a spreadsheet to crunch the numbers, ensuring your clock’s materials are accounted for and within a reasonable cost. These planning skills are just as important as the hands-on skills – they ensure that a project is feasible and efficient before you make sawdust. Moving forward, you’ll bring everything together: with a clear plan in hand and most construction done, we’ll focus on final assembly and reflection. Great work on developing a professional approach to project planning!</p>
