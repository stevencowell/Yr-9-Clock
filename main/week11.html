<summary><strong>Week 11: Safe Work Method Statements (SWMS)</strong></summary>
<article>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Welcome to Week 11 of the Clock project. This week we stepped back from hands-on building to focus on planning for <strong>safety</strong>. We learned about the <strong>Safe Work Method Statement (SWMS)</strong>, a structured document used to identify hazards and decide how to work safely. On big construction sites, SWMS are mandatory for dangerous tasks, but the idea applies to our classroom too: <em>think before you act</em>. In class, you began writing a SWMS for the remaining steps of your clock project – listing each task, the dangers (hazards) at that step, and how to reduce the risks. We also talked about the “hierarchy of control” – a fancy term for ranking safety measures from best to last resort. By the end of the week, you were thinking like a safety planner, breaking down your project into safe, organised steps rather than just charging ahead.</p>

<h4>What Exactly Is a SWMS?</h4>
<p>A <strong>Safe Work Method Statement</strong> is basically a safety game-plan on paper. It asks three main questions: <em>What are the hazards?</em> (what could go wrong or cause harm?), <em>What are the risks?</em> (how serious could it be and how likely is it?), and <em>How will we control those risks?</em> (what steps will we take to prevent an accident?). We looked at an example SWMS for a simple task (using a power drill). The example listed the task’s steps (e.g. “Drill a hole in timber”), the hazards (“drill bit could snap, wood chips flying, loud noise”), the risks (“injury from flying pieces, eye damage, hearing damage”), and controls (“use a sharp bit and proper speed, wear safety glasses and ear muffs, clamp the timber securely”). Writing this out might feel tedious, but it forces you to slow down and plan out safety. When you applied this to your clock project, you realised even a small project has important safety steps – like double-checking the drill press setup before drilling, or wearing a dust mask when sanding.</p>
<h4>The Hierarchy of Hazard Controls</h4>
<p>One big concept we covered is the <strong>hierarchy of controls</strong> – think of it as a safety ladder from most effective to least effective controls. At the very top is <strong>Elimination</strong> – remove the hazard entirely if you can (this is the best option: no hazard, no harm). Next is <strong>Substitution</strong> – replace the hazard with something safer (for example, using a less toxic finish instead of a very poisonous one). After that comes <strong>Engineering controls</strong> – physically isolate or reduce the hazard (like using an exhaust fan or guard on a machine to keep dust or blades away from people). Then <strong>Administrative controls</strong> – these are rules and procedures (for instance, only allowing trained people to use certain equipment, or scheduling noisy work when fewer people are around). Last on the list – the least effective by itself – is <strong>PPE</strong> (Personal Protective Equipment, like gloves, goggles, or masks). PPE is considered the last line of defence because it doesn’t remove the hazard; it just helps protect you if something goes wrong. We discussed examples: for a dusty task like sanding, an engineering control would be turning on the dust extraction vacuum, an administrative control would be limiting sanding time or doing it when others aren’t nearby, and PPE would be wearing your dust mask and goggles. The takeaway was that you should try to eliminate or reduce a hazard with higher-level controls first, and not rely only on PPE.</p>

<h4>Sequencing Work for Safety</h4>
<p>Another thing your SWMS made you consider was the <strong>sequence of work</strong>. The order in which you do tasks can affect safety. We talked about doing higher-risk tasks (like cutting or machining wood) earlier on, when you’re fresh and the pieces are still easy to handle, and saving lower-risk finishing tasks (like detailed sanding or staining) for later. For example, it’s safer to cut all your pieces while they are still large and easy to clamp, rather than after assembly when you’d be cutting something small and potentially unstable. By planning out the steps of your project in order, you avoided scenarios like “Oops, I needed to drill a hole earlier when it was easier to secure the piece.” Through this sequencing exercise, you noticed how each step set up the next one to be safer and easier. This planning is basically applying project management thinking to safety – something professional woodworkers do all the time.</p>
<h4>Completing the Clock Project SWMS</h4>
<p>During the practical part of the week, you either worked in teams or individually to write a SWMS specifically for your clock project. You identified hazards for each remaining step: for example, cutting the remaining trim (hazard: sharp saw, flying splinters), assembling the clock body (hazard: hammering nails could hit fingers, glue fumes), or sanding and finishing (hazard: wood dust and vapors). For each hazard, you wrote down control measures. Often, you realised you were already doing many of these controls by habit – wearing safety glasses when cutting, using clamps or a vice to hold wood, asking for help when moving something heavy. We reviewed a couple of students’ SWMS sheets as a class and discussed whether the proposed controls were the best ones, or if we could think of even safer alternatives. By the end of the exercise, you had a written safety roadmap for finishing your project. The process might have felt formal, but it summed up a lot of what we’ve been practicing all term: working safely is not just about reacting if something goes wrong, it’s about planning ahead so things <em>don’t</em> go wrong in the first place.</p>
<h4>Discussion Questions</h4>
<ol>
<li>In your own words, what is the purpose of a Safe Work Method Statement (SWMS), and when might you need one outside of school?</li>
<li>Give an example of a hazard you identified in your clock project and describe one control you put in place to manage it.</li>
<li>Why do you think elimination and substitution are ranked higher than PPE in the hierarchy of controls?</li>
<li>How did planning the order of tasks (the sequence) help make the project work safer or easier?</li>
<li>Now that you’ve completed a SWMS, do you feel differently about approaching new projects or tasks? Why or why not?</li>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>By completing a SWMS for your clock, you learned to see your project through the eyes of safety. This week’s theory showed that building something isn’t just about the end product – it’s also about <em>how</em> you get there without anyone getting hurt. You discovered the hierarchy of controls, giving you a framework to tackle hazards from the best angle. Writing down a step-by-step safety plan might have felt new, but it encapsulated many lessons we’ve been practicing all along, like thinking ahead and taking precautions. Going forward, whether you’re in a workshop, science lab, or anywhere doing a task, you can use the same mindset: identify the risks, control them smartly (don’t just rely on gear), and work in a logical order. As we move on to the finishing stages of the clock, keep this safety-first approach in mind. You’re not just crafting a clock – you’re developing the habits of a thoughtful, safety-conscious maker.</p>
