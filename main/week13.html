<summary><strong>Week 13: Oil Finish Application &amp; Self-Evaluation</strong></summary>
<article>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Week 13 marked an exciting milestone: putting the <strong>finish</strong> on the clock project and taking time to reflect on the whole process. After all the cutting, assembling, and sanding, this week you finally applied a clear oil finish to your clock to bring out the beauty of the wood. While waiting for the oil to dry, you also worked on a <strong>self-evaluation</strong> of your project, thinking about what went well, what was challenging, and how you’ve grown as a budding woodworker. In essence, this week was about giving your clock its final protective sheen and looking back on the journey you took to make it.</p>

<h4>Timber Finishes: Oils and More</h4>
<p>In class we started by discussing different <strong>timber finishes</strong> and why we finish wood at all. Finishing serves two main purposes: <em>protection</em> (guarding the wood against moisture, dirt, and wear) and <em>appearance</em> (enhancing the colour and grain, and giving a desired sheen from matte to glossy). We listed common finishes: oils (like Danish oil or linseed oil), clear varnishes and polyurethanes, shellac, waxes, and paints. Each has its uses – for example, we noted that <strong>oil finishes</strong> tend to soak into the wood and give a natural look, while <strong>varnishes</strong> create a hard film on top of the wood that’s very protective but a bit less “natural” looking. We chose Danish oil for the clock project because it’s a beginner-friendly finish that really brings out the grain of pine, is relatively safe to work with, and doesn’t require fancy equipment. (Plus, Danish oil is basically a mix of oil and varnish that gives a nice balance of penetration and protection.) We compared it to something like shellac or lacquer which dry faster but often are sprayed on and need more skill. By learning about various finishes, you got a sense that there’s a whole world of choices depending on what a project needs – outdoor furniture, for instance, might need a marine varnish, whereas a cutting board might just get a food-safe oil. We also touched on a safety note: some finishes (like oil-based ones) have fumes or can be flammable, so always cheque the instructions and work in a ventilated space.</p>
<h4>Applying the Oil Finish</h4>
<p>The highlight of the week was actually <strong>applying the oil finish</strong> to your clock. We prepared by making sure each clock was dust-free (good thing we did that thorough sanding cleanup last week!). You used clean, lint-free cloths (rags) to apply the Danish oil. The method was straightforward: pour a small amount of oil onto the rag or directly onto the wood, then wipe it onto the wood following the grain. You quickly saw the wood transform – the pine’s grain and colour became richer and slightly darker, and the unique patterns in each piece of wood “popped” out. We reminded everyone to apply a thin, even coat. With oil finishes, more is not better – the wood can only absorb so much. After letting the oil sit on the surface for about 5-10 minutes, you went back and wiped off any excess. This is important because any oil that just sits on the surface without soaking in can become sticky or dry unevenly. We propped up the clocks on stands (so they wouldn’t stick to the newspaper beneath) and allowed them to start drying. Meanwhile, we talked about how many coats might be needed – typically 2 or 3 coats of oil give a good result, with a day of drying in between. Since our class periods are shorter, we planned to apply the second coat in the next session or whenever the first coat was fully dry.</p>
<p>We also emphasised <strong>safe handling of oily rags</strong>. An important safety tip you learned is that oil-soaked rags can spontaneously catch fire if not handled properly! This isn’t a myth – as the oil cures, it generates heat. If rags are left crumpled up, that heat can build up and ignite the cloth. So, we made sure to lay out used oily rags flat to dry, or better yet, submerge them in water in a metal container for disposal. It might sound extreme, but it’s a real hazard in woodshops. You all took this seriously (nobody wants their project to end in flames!), and we collected the rags in a safe manner.</p>
<h4>Self-Evaluation: Looking Back on the Project</h4>
<p>While the oil was doing its magic on the wood, you switched gears to begin your <strong>self-evaluation</strong>. This is a chance to be both the creator and the critic of your work. Each of you received a self-evaluation worksheet (or prompts in your workbook) with questions about the project. You reflected on questions like: “How well does your finished clock match the design you originally drew?” and “What was the biggest challenge you faced, and how did you overcome it?” You also considered what you would do differently if you could do the project again – this could be about time management, a technique you would improve, or even a design element you might change. At first, some found it odd to “grade” themselves, but as we discussed, self-evaluation is not about penalising yourself – it’s about recognising what you learned and identifying ways to improve. We shared a few thoughts as a class: one student noted they wished they had been more patient with sanding, another was proud of learning to use the drill press confidently, and someone else mentioned they would choose a different stain colour if they did it again. By writing these thoughts down, you’re essentially having a conversation with your future self – the next time you tackle a project, you can remember these insights.</p>
<h4>Oiling Progress and Next Steps</h4>
<p>Toward the end of the week, we checked on the clocks. Some had already absorbed most of the oil and were dry to the touch; those were given a very light sanding with extra-fine grit or steel wool (just to knock down any tiny wood fibers that rose up) and then a second coat of oil was applied. The room had that distinct smell of oil finish – not unpleasant, but a sign that real finishing work was happening! The clocks now have a warmer tone and a subtle sheen. Many of you were quite excited to see how “professional” the projects started to look once the finish went on. We left the clocks over the weekend to cure. You’ll notice the oil finish isn’t glossy; it’s more of a soft glow that really suits a timber project like this. We discussed that if we wanted a glossy, highly protective finish, we could add a coat of polyurethane varnish on top or use a different finishing product, but the trade-off would be a more artificial look. For our purposes, the Danish oil’s natural finish was just right.</p>
<h4>Discussion Questions</h4>
<ol>
<li>What does applying an oil finish do for the wood, both in terms of protection and appearance?</li>
<li>Name one other type of wood finish (besides oil) and mention where or why it might be used.</li>
<li>What safety precautions should you take when working with oil finishes and oil-soaked rags?</li>
<li>In your self-evaluation, what is one thing you realised you did well during the project?</li>
<li>What is one thing you would do differently next time, based on your reflection about this project?</li>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Week 13 was both rewarding and reflective. Seeing the oil bring your clock to life was a satisfying moment – the pale, sanded timber gained a richer colour and a gentle sheen, highlighting the work you’ve put into it. You also learned that finishing is a careful process: thin coats, patience, and safety precautions with materials like oily rags. Equally important, taking time for self-evaluation helped you recognise how far you’ve come since the start of the project (and even since the breadboard in the previous unit). By honestly assessing your work, you set the stage for continuous improvement in future projects. The skills you practiced – from applying a finish to thinking critically about your own process – are skills you’ll carry forward. With the clock now oiled and looking great, and your thoughts on the project captured in your folio, you’re nearly at the finish line. All that remains is a final test of knowledge and the proud moment of handing in your work, which we’ll tackle in the coming week.</p>
