<summary><strong>Week 4: Main Body Assembly &amp; Rebate Joints</strong></summary>
<article>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>In Week 4, you moved from preparing individual pieces to assembling the main body of the clock. This week’s practical focus was on joining the front panel to the side panels (forming the basic carcass of the clock) and introducing the <strong>rebate joint</strong> to recess the back panel. By the end of the week, you had a three-sided frame (front and sides) clamped and glued up, and you practiced cutting neat rebates along the inside edges in preparation for fitting the back. We also connected what we’re doing in class to real-world woodworking by discussing how industry uses similar joints and techniques on a larger scale.</p>

<h4>Cutting Rebate Joints by Hand</h4>
<p>A <strong>rebate joint</strong> (also known as a rabbet joint in the US) is a simple but effective way to join two pieces at right angles by removing a portion of one piece’s edge so that another piece can sit into it. This week, we marked and cut rebates on the inside back edges of the side panels (and prepared for similar cuts on the top and bottom pieces) to eventually let the back panel fit flush. To cut the rebate by hand, we used a combination of saw and chisel. First, you marked out the area to remove: the depth of the cut equal to the thickness of the back panel. Using a try square and marking gauge, you drew lines to guide your saw cut – one line across the width of the side panel where the rebate would stop, and another along the edge to indicate the depth.</p>
<p>After securely clamping the wood, you made careful saw cuts down the shoulder (the cross-grain cut) and along the cheek (with the grain). We used a tenon saw to ensure straight, controlled cuts. Once the waste section was sawed, you chiseled out the remaining wood in the notch, working slowly and keeping the chisel bevel down for control. It was important to chisel *with* the grain where possible to avoid splitting beyond the intended line. The result is a right-angled notch where the back panel’s edge will eventually sit. We discussed how a properly cut rebate increases the gluing surface area and helps align the pieces during assembly, making the joint stronger and the back panel flush with the sides.</p>
<h4>Assembling the Clock’s Carcass</h4>
<p>With the front and side panels prepared, you proceeded to assemble the main body (or carcass) of the clock. This involved applying wood glue to the mating surfaces (the ends of the side panels and the inside edges of the front panel) and clamping them together at a perfect 90° angle. We used corner clamps and checked with a try square to ensure the front and sides met cleanly. **Why glue and not nails or screws?** At this stage, the joints are primarily simple butt joints reinforced by the upcoming rebates and back panel. Wood adhesive (PVA glue) provides a surprisingly strong bond when the surfaces fit well. By clamping the assembly firmly, we squeezed out any gaps (excess glue that seeped out was wiped away to keep the project neat). After the glue set, the front and sides formed a rigid U-shaped structure.</p>
<p>Patience was key here – we let the glued frame dry sufficiently (at least 30 minutes under clamp pressure) before moving it. This prevented stressing the joints while the glue cured. The class also noted how **squaring up** the assembly now makes everything easier down the line: if the carcass is assembled out of square, the clock face or back panel might not fit properly. By the end of the session, you had a sturdy three-sided carcass. The back panel was left off for now, since we’ll fit it after cutting all rebates and when we’re ready to enclose the clock’s insides. This approach also made clamping and later steps (like inserting the clock mechanism or finishing the interior) more manageable.</p>
<h4>Industry Insight: Joinery at Scale</h4>
<p>During theory time, we looked at how the same principles are applied in the woodworking and cabinetmaking industry. In a factory or professional workshop, a rebate joint is extremely common – for example, cabinet backs and drawer bottoms are often set in rebates. However, instead of cutting them by hand, tradespeople might use power tools like a <strong>router</strong> with a rebate bit or a table saw with a dado blade to cut the notch quickly and accurately. We watched a short segment of a woodworking video showing a router effortlessly cutting a long, even rebate. This highlighted why learning the hand method is still valuable: it gives you understanding of the joint’s purpose and challenges, so you know what a good tight rebate looks like. In industry, knowing *why* a rebate is used (to add strength and alignment) is as important as knowing how to cut one. We also discussed how quality control in manufacturing ensures joints like these are consistent for every product. Your experience with hand tools this week mirrors, on a smaller scale, what larger shops do with machinery – the concepts of measuring carefully, securing workpieces, and aiming for a flush, strong joint remain the same.</p>

It illustrates why woodworkers choose these joints and one method of making them (in larger scale productions or with machines).</p>
<h4>Discussion Questions</h4>
<ol>
<li>What advantages does a rebate joint have over a simple butt joint when joining two pieces of timber at a right angle?</li>
<li>Which tools did you use to cut the rebate joint by hand, and why is each tool important in the process?</li>
<li>When gluing the front and side panels together, why is it important to cheque that the assembly is square (90°)? How might an out-of-square carcass affect the final clock?</li>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>By the end of Week 4, you transformed a collection of flat panels into a sturdy three-dimensional structure. In doing so, you learned how a rebate joint adds strength and neatness to a corner and practiced careful gluing and clamping techniques. This week underscored the value of precision and patience – your clock’s carcass is now square, secure, and ready for the next steps. With the main body assembled, you’re well prepared to add the remaining pieces (like the top, bottom, and later the drawer) and know that a strong foundation will make the rest of the project go smoothly.</p>
