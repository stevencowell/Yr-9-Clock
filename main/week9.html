<summary><strong>Week 9: Drawer Assembly &amp; Timber Properties Review</strong></summary>
<article>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Week 9 is all about bringing together your project’s moving part – the drawer – and strengthening your understanding of timber properties. In this week, you’ll assemble and fine-tune the clock’s drawer so it fits smoothly into the carcass. Alongside the hands-on work, we’re reviewing key characteristics of wood such as <strong>durability</strong> (how well a timber resists rot and wear) and <strong>workability</strong> (how easy it is to cut, shape, and join). We will also contrast different timber types you’ve encountered, assess the quality of your almost-complete project, and brainstorm improvements. By revisiting these concepts now, you’ll be better prepared to evaluate your finished clock and justify your material choices.</p>
<h4>Timber Durability &amp; Workability</h4>
<p>Not all woods behave the same. Some timbers are extremely <strong>durable</strong> – they naturally resist decay, insect attack, and the passage of time. For example, cedar and jarrah are known for lasting outdoors without rotting, whereas a wood like radiata pine (commonly used in class projects) isn’t as durable outside because it can absorb moisture and invite rot. Durability matters for a project’s longevity: a clock made from a durable hardwood might become a long-lasting heirloom, but durability often comes with increased hardness.</p>
<p>That’s where <strong>workability</strong> comes in. Workability describes how easy a timber is to saw, plane, drill or sand. Softer woods like pine are generally easier to work – your tools cut through them like butter. Hardwoods like spotted gum or oak, on the other hand, are tougher on tools and require more effort to shape, but reward you with strength and rich grain. In our clock project, we chose wood that balances these factors: a timber that is user-friendly for Year 9 students to work with, yet sturdy enough for a quality product. Understanding a wood’s workability helps you plan your cuts and joins; understanding its durability tells you how it might hold up over time.</p>
<h4>Contrasting Timber Types</h4>
<p>You’ve learned about hardwoods versus softwoods in earlier weeks. Now we apply that knowledge by examining the pieces of your clock. The term <strong>hardwood</strong> doesn’t always mean “hard” (for instance, balsa is a hardwood that’s very soft) and <strong>softwood</strong> doesn’t always mean “soft” (douglas fir is a softwood that’s quite hard). The classification is about tree types (deciduous vs coniferous), but in practise, hardwoods like jarrah or oak tend to be denser and have attractive grain patterns, while softwoods like pine or cedar tend to be lighter and easier to cut. We also discussed using contrasting timbers in design – for example, an accent strip of a darker hardwood against a lighter pine can make your clock visually striking. As you look at your project, notice the grain and colour of the wood. Are there knots in the pine boards? Knots add character but can be harder to cut through and may weaken that spot. This review of timber types helps you justify why the materials in your folio were chosen, and imagine how using a different wood might have changed the building process or final look.</p>

<small>Different timber boards can vary in grain and knot frequency. Softer pines often have many knots (as seen above), affecting workability, whereas a clear-grained hardwood board may saw more cleanly.</small>

<h4>Quality Assessment &amp; Improvements</h4>
<p>With the main assembly nearly complete, it’s time to critically assess your workmanship. Does your drawer slide in and out smoothly without binding? Are the drawer’s front face and surrounding edges flush, giving a neat appearance? Quality assessment involves checking both <em>function</em> and <em>aesthetics</em>: the drawer should function properly (not too tight or too loose) and look good (no obvious gaps or rough edges). We examine joints for tight fits and ensure there’s no excess glue or misaligned parts. If you find issues, this is the perfect moment to think of <strong>improvements</strong>. For example, if the drawer was initially too snug, you might gently plane the sides of the drawer or sand the opening until the fit is just right. If there’s a small gap, consider how you could have measured or cut more accurately – “measure twice, cut once” always applies. Thinking about improvements isn’t about criticising your work; it’s about learning. Maybe you realise a different joint (like using a small rebate for the drawer corners instead of just butt joints) could add strength, or that adding a wax or soap finish could help the drawer glide better. By evaluating quality now, you’ll carry these lessons into future projects and understand how to approach the final finishing steps next.</p>
<h4>Discussion Questions</h4>
<ol>
<li>What does it mean for a timber to be “durable,” and why might that matter for a project that will be kept for many years?</li>
<li>Which would be easier to shape by hand – a piece of radiata pine or a piece of oak – and what trade-offs come with that choice?</li>
<li>As you fitted your drawer, what signs told you the fit was either too tight or too loose, and how did you address it?</li>
<li>Name one aspect of your clock that you are happy with (quality-wise), and one aspect you think you could improve if you built it again. What would you do differently next time?</li>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>In Week 9, you successfully fitted the clock’s drawer and took a closer look at what makes wood “good” for a project. By combining practical skills (like fine-tuning a drawer with a plane) and theory (reviewing timber durability and workability), you gained insight into choosing the right material and achieving a quality outcome. You should now be able to explain why the timber you used was appropriate and spot areas to improve in your work. These reflection skills are as important as the build itself – they turn a simple project into a learning experience about materials and craftsmanship. With the drawer in place and knowledge in mind, you’re ready to move on to final touches, keeping safety and quality at the forefront.</p>
