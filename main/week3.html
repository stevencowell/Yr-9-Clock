<summary><strong>Week 3: Wood Properties &amp; Project Planning</strong></summary>
<article>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Week 3 centered on deepening our understanding of the material we work with – wood – and making sure our project plans are solid. You learned about the internal structure of wood and some common defects that can occur. We also took time to work on workshop drawings for the clock, which are like a roadmap for our build. By solidifying the theory behind wood properties and visualising the project on paper, we are better prepared to carry out the remaining construction steps accurately.</p>

<h4>Understanding Timber Structure</h4>
<p>To truly understand wood, it helps to know how a tree grows. If you’ve seen the circular rings in a tree stump, you know that each ring represents one year of growth. These <strong>growth rings</strong> form because trees grow faster in spring (producing lighter, wider-grain wood) and slower in late summer (darker, denser wood). By the time a tree is cut into lumber, these rings appear as lines or patterns we call the <em>grain</em>.</p>
<p>The grain isn’t just for looks – it affects how wood behaves. Wood is anisotropic, meaning its properties change depending on direction. For example, wood is strongest along the grain (that’s why you try to align grain along the length of a table leg, for strength) and weakest across the grain (wood splits easier along the grain lines). We also discussed wood’s moisture content: fresh-cut wood (called green wood) contains a lot of water in its cells. As it dries, it shrinks a bit and can distort. That’s why wood is <strong>seasoned (dried)</strong> before use – more on seasoning in Week 6.</p>
<p>We looked at a cross-section diagram of a tree and identified the <strong>heartwood</strong> (the older, often darker, inner wood) and <strong>sapwood</strong> (younger, outer wood). Heartwood tends to be more durable and less prone to rot because it can contain stored compounds; sapwood is usually lighter and where the tree’s active water transport happens. This can matter: some projects avoid sapwood for consistency in colour or properties, while others don’t mind. For our clock, either is fine as long as the wood is dry and sound.</p>
<h4>Timber Defects</h4>
<p>No piece of wood is perfect. We identified common <strong>defects</strong> in timber:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Knots:</strong> These are the round, darker spots where branches were. Knots are harder than the surrounding wood and can be tricky – they might fall out or cause a tool to jump if not careful. They do add character to how the wood looks.</li>
<li><strong>Warping:</strong> This includes twists, bows, or cups in a board. Wood can warp if it dries unevenly or if it’s cut from a certain part of the log. That’s why properly seasoning wood (and sometimes cutting it in specific ways, like quarter-sawing) reduces warping.</li>
<li><strong>Cracks/Splits:</strong> Sometimes called checks, these are fractures usually at the ends of boards where drying started too fast. A split can weaken a piece. We ensure our clock panels don’t have major splits for structural reasons.</li>
<li><strong>Gum Veins or Resin Pockets:</strong> Especially in species like pine, you might see lines or pockets of resin (sap that hardened). These don’t usually cause structural issues, but they can clog sandpaper and affect finishing (stains might not take evenly).</li>
</ul>
<p>Recognising defects is important. For instance, if you have a knot right where you need to drill or cut a joint, you might reposition your template or choose a different piece of wood. In our class, we tried to place templates (like the clock face hole) in clear wood areas to avoid these problems.</p>
<h4>Additional Resource: Wood Defects</h4>
<p>For pictures and more detailed explanations of wood defects, visit <a href="https://www.davidstimber.com.au/resource-centre/wood-defects/" style="color: blue;" target="_blank">this resource on timber defects</a>. It shows examples of knots, warping, and other imperfections and discusses how they affect the use of the wood.</p>
<h4>Workshop Drawings</h4>
<p>We transitioned from theory to planning by working on <strong>workshop drawings</strong> for the clock. There are a couple of types:
          <ul>
<li><em>Orthographic projection</em>: This is a set of flat views (front, side, top) of an object. We practiced drawing at least two views of the clock (for example, front view showing the clock face and drawer, and a side view showing its depth). These drawings are to scale or with dimensions labeled, so they guide construction accurately.</li>
<li><em>Isometric sketch</em>: This is a 3D representation drawn at a 30° angle, which gives a clear idea of what the finished clock will look like. It’s not always to scale, but it’s useful for visualising and communicating design ideas. Many of you sketched an isometric view of the clock to include in your folio.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Making these drawings helps in a few ways. It forces you to think through the project – how will pieces fit together, and what are their exact sizes? It often reveals if something was missing in the plan (for example, if you forgot to account for the thickness of the timber in the overall width). Moreover, if someone else saw your drawings, they should have enough information to build the clock themselves. That’s the ultimate test of a good technical drawing.</p>
<p>We also used the drawings to double-cheque our cutting list. By having every part drawn and labeled, you can cross verify all parts are accounted for and have correct dimensions. This practise of drawing and listing prevents issues like cutting a piece to the wrong size or forgetting a piece entirely.</p>
<h4>Discussion Questions</h4>
<ol>
<li>Name one natural defect in wood and describe how it might affect your clock project.</li>
<li>Why is it useful to create an orthographic or isometric drawing before (or while) building your project?</li>
<li>How do growth rings (the tree’s annual rings) relate to the strength or stability of a piece of timber?</li>
</ol>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>In Week 3, you gained insight into the very material you’re crafting with – wood – learning how its natural properties can influence your work. You also translated your project into technical drawings, bridging the gap between concept and reality. With a solid understanding of timber characteristics and a clear project plan in hand, you’re well-prepared to continue building. Next, we’ll apply this knowledge as we cut joinery and start assembling parts, while also looking at how our classroom techniques compare to what professionals do in industry.</p>
