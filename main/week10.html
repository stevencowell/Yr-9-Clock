<summary><strong>Week 10: Workshop Maintenance &amp; WHS</strong></summary>
<article>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Week 10 shifts focus from building to maintaining – both the workshop and our safety standards. After many weeks of cutting and assembling, it’s time to step back and make sure our workspace and tools are in good shape. A well-maintained workshop is a safe workshop. In this week’s sessions, we will cover essential <strong>WHS (Work Health and Safety)</strong> practices related to housekeeping: safe handling of materials (so you don’t strain your back or drop heavy wood on your feet), eliminating trip hazards (because off-cuts and clutter on the floor can cause accidents), and working together to clean and organise. We’ll also look at basic tool maintenance – simple tasks like wiping down, sharpening, or storing tools properly to keep them working well and safely. By week’s end, the workshop will be tidier, and you’ll understand why upkeep and safety go hand-in-hand.</p>
<h4>Safe Handling &amp; Housekeeping</h4>
<p>Our first topic is <strong>manual handling</strong> – essentially, how to lift and carry things safely. We demonstrated the proper way to pick up a stack of timber: keep your back straight, bend your knees, and lift with your legs (not your back) to avoid injury. We also practiced carrying long materials with a partner, communicating clearly (“Turning left!” or “Watch the door!”) so everyone moves safely together. Keeping aisles clear is a simple but crucial habit: a stray clamp on the ground or an off-cut can easily become a trip hazard. In the theory discussion, we revisited the importance of “good housekeeping” in the workshop. This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Putting away tools after you use them, in the right place.</li>
<li>Cleaning up sawdust and wood scraps (using a broom and dustpan, not your hands) to prevent slips and fires.</li>
<li>Coiling up power cords and storing equipment so that walkways are clear.</li>
</ul>
<p>These might sound like common-sense steps, but it’s amazing how quickly a busy class can turn a clean workshop into a messy one. By doing a mid-project cleanup, we not only make the space safer – we also take pride in our environment and show respect for the tools and facilities.</p>
<h4>Tool Maintenance and Care</h4>
<p>Next, we turned to <strong>tool maintenance</strong>. Even the best tool can become unsafe if neglected. For example, a chisel that’s dull forces you to push harder, which can lead to slips – a sharp chisel is actually safer and yields cleaner cuts. We discussed how to tell when a tool needs care: does a saw feel gummed up or not cut straight (time to clean the blade), do screws on the plane feel loose (grab a screwdriver and tighten them), are the battery-powered drills charged and stored correctly? As a class, we performed a simple maintenance task: each student picked a tool or area to inspect and fix up. Some oiled the vice screws to keep them moving freely, others checked the condition of sanding blocks and replaced the sandpaper. We even looked at tool alignment – for instance, ensuring the drill press table is clean and square. Through this, you learned that regular maintenance isn’t complicated: it’s about <em>regularly checking, cleaning, and fixing minor issues</em> before they become big problems. It extends the life of equipment and prevents accidents (like a hammer head flying off a loose handle!). Plus, a well-maintained set of tools makes your work more enjoyable and precise.</p>

<h4>WHS Responsibilities &amp; Signage</h4>
<p>Maintaining a workshop is also about understanding everyone’s <strong>WHS responsibilities</strong>. We emphasised that safety is a shared duty: it’s not just the teacher or the captains who should think about safety – <em>everyone</em> in the workshop contributes. This means if you see a spill, you clean it (or report it); if you notice a frayed power cord, you unplug it and inform the teacher; if a classmate is carrying something heavy, you offer help or at least ensure their path is clear. We also took a quick tour of common <strong>safety signage</strong> around the workshop. You probably see these signs every day without a second thought – green signs for first aid kits and exits, yellow triangle signs warning of specific hazards (like a sign near the lathe reading “Wear Eye Protection”), and red signs for fire equipment or emergency stops. Understanding these symbols is part of being a safe worker. By paying attention to signage and remembering the simple rules behind each symbol (e.g., a figure wearing goggles means you must have eye protection in that area), you stay proactively safe. In summary, knowing the rules is one thing, but actively keeping the workshop in order and following the posted signs makes safety a natural part of how we work.</p>
<h4>Discussion Questions</h4>
<ol>
<li>Why is it important to lift with your legs (and not your back) when moving heavy timber or equipment?</li>
<li>What are two benefits of keeping the workshop clean and organised during a project, not just at the end?</li>
<li>Can you name a maintenance task you did (or observed) this week? How does that task improve safety or tool performance?</li>
<li>Think of a safety sign you’ve seen in the workshop (for example, a sign requiring eye protection). What behaviour does it encourage or mandate, and why is that important?</li>
<li>Whose responsibility is it to maintain a safe workshop? Explain your answer with an example.</li>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>By the end of Week 10, our workshop was cleaner, our tools were in better shape, and everyone had a clearer understanding of daily safety habits. You saw firsthand that safety isn’t just about dramatic precautions during cutting or drilling – it’s woven into the everyday tasks of lifting correctly, tidying up, and keeping equipment in top condition. These practices might seem mundane, but they prevent injuries and ensure the workshop runs smoothly for everyone. The skills you practiced – from coiling a cable properly to checking a blade’s sharpness – are ones you’ll carry into any future workshop or workplace. With a safe environment restored and knowledge of WHS principles reinforced, we can move forward to the final stages of our clock project with confidence and care.</p>
