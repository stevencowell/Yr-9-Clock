<summary><strong>Week 5: Top &amp; Bottom Chamfers; Body Assembly Completion</strong></summary>
<article>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Week 5 was all about adding the “lid” and “base” of your clock and giving them a professional touch. We took the top and bottom pieces of the clock, cut them to size, and then used hand planes to put a <strong>chamfer</strong> on their edges. A chamfer is a small 45° bevel cut along an edge, and it instantly improves the look of the piece by breaking sharp corners and catching the light. After chamfering, you glued and clamped the top and bottom onto the clock’s body (the carcass from last week), completing the basic structure of the clock. This was a satisfying milestone: the project now actually looks like a clock case, and you honed two important skills – precise planing and proper gluing techniques.</p>

</div>
<h4>Chamfering Edges with a Hand Plane</h4>
<p>Creating an even chamfer by hand is a classic woodworker’s skill. We started by marking out guidelines on the top and bottom pieces. Using a pencil, you lightly drew a line a set distance from the edge (for example, ~5 mm in from the edge on the top face, and a similar line on the adjacent side face). These lines served as boundaries so you would know when to stop planing – essentially outlining the width and depth of the chamfer. With the piece secured in a vice or with clamps, you held a <strong>block plane</strong> at roughly a 45° angle and began shaving off the corner, from the top pencil line down to the side pencil line.</p>
<p>It’s important to plane in the correct direction: just like with any planing or chiseling, going “with the grain” yields a smoother cut, whereas going against it can cause tear-out. Many of you noticed that from one end of the board, the plane produced smooth curls of shavings, but starting from the opposite end tended to lift the grain. The remedy was to plane from each end toward the middle if needed, or adjust your angle, to always cut with the grain. As you planed, you checked that the chamfer was developing evenly. The goal was a consistent width of the beveled edge all along each side of the piece. Taking light cuts is key – thin shavings give you control and a cleaner finish. If one spot had a thicker chamfer than the rest, we guided you to plane a bit more on either side to even it out rather than continuing to dig into the low spot.</p>
<p>By practising on a scrap piece first, you got a feel for the correct angle and pressure. Once confident, you chamfered the visible edges of the top and bottom pieces of your clock. Why chamfer at all? Besides looking nice (it gives a shadow line and makes the clock look less “blocky”), chamfering removes the sharp 90° corners that could splinter or even cause injury. It’s a simple detail that improves both aesthetics and safety. We discussed how chamfers (or similar edge treatments like round-overs) are common in furniture. This experience also further improved your plane-handling skills – controlling a plane for a precise bevel is a bit trickier than planing a flat face, and now you’ve done it!</p>
<h4>Gluing the Top and Bottom in Place</h4>
<p>After chamfering, the top and bottom pieces were ready to attach. This step essentially “sealed” the carcass, turning your open-ended frame into a fully enclosed box (minus the back and drawer opening). We did a dry-fit first: placing the top and bottom on the carcass to ensure they sat correctly – edges flush, and no gaps. Because of the careful measuring and cutting in prior weeks, everything aligned well. You then applied an even layer of wood glue (PVA) to the contact surfaces: the top edges of the front, side panels and any part of the back edge that the top piece would touch, and similarly for the bottom piece. It was important to use the right amount of glue – enough to bond, but not so much that it flooded out over your nice chamfers. (Any squeeze-out that did appear was quickly wiped off with a damp rag to prevent staining the wood.)</p>
<p>We placed the top piece on and ensured equal overhang (if the top was cut a little larger for a lip) or perfect alignment (if it was cut flush with the sides). Clamps were then used to press the top down onto the carcass while the glue set. We were careful to put scrap wood pads under the clamp jaws where they touched the chamfered edges, to avoid denting the nicely planed bevels. For the bottom piece, the process was the same: align it carefully and clamp it up. We checked all around to confirm that the top and bottom were sitting properly – a common mistake can be slight shifting under clamp pressure. Using a square and measuring tape, we verified that both the top and bottom pieces were centered and the clock’s sides were not bowed out or pulled in.</p>
<p>This stage also reinforced good glue-up practices. For instance, we talked about working time: standard PVA gives you a few minutes to adjust parts before it starts to grab, so you must get clamps on and make adjustments efficiently. We also mentioned that glue reaches full strength after about 24 hours, although it sets much sooner. In class, we left the clamps on until the next session to be safe. Once unclamped, the clock’s structure was complete and solid. Many of you tapped the top or side of your clock and remarked how “finished” it suddenly felt now that it has a top and bottom!</p>

It offers tips on making strong glue joints and explains why properly clamped, tight-fitting joints are critical for strength.</p>
<h4>Discussion Questions</h4>
<ol>
<li>In your own words, what is a chamfer and why did we add chamfers to the top and bottom pieces of the clock?</li>
<li>What hand tool did you use to create the chamfer, and how did you ensure your chamfer was even along the entire edge?</li>
<li>Why is it important to plane or cut “with the grain” when making a chamfer? What can happen if you go against the grain?</li>
<li>When gluing the top and bottom onto the clock, what did you do to make sure each piece was positioned correctly before the glue dried?</li>
<li>We used scrap wood pads between the clamps and the chamfered edges while clamping. What was the purpose of those pads?</li>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>In Week 5, you put the “roof and floor” on your clock project, transforming it into a complete enclosure (aside from the back and drawer). You learned how small details like chamfers can elevate the quality of your work, and you got comfortable using a hand plane for precision work. By successfully gluing the top and bottom in place, you’ve completed the core assembly of the clock. The skills practised – from careful measuring and planing to proper clamping and gluing – are fundamental in woodworking. Now that the clock’s body is fully assembled, you’re ready to tackle the remaining elements (like the back panel, drawer, and finishing touches) with a strong structure in hand and growing confidence in your techniques.</p>
