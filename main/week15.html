<summary><strong>Week 15: Project Hand-In &amp; Wrap-Up</strong></summary>
<article>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Week 15 was the final week of the Clock project unit – a time to wrap everything up neatly and celebrate what you’ve accomplished. The main event was the <strong>hand-in</strong> of your completed clock projects and the accompanying work folios for marking. This week had no new theory or practical skills to learn; instead, it was about making sure all the T’s were crossed and I’s dotted. We took a step back to summarise the journey from start to finish, and you got to see everyone’s clocks lined up together – each one a little different, reflecting the personal touches each of you added. It was a satisfying conclusion to see raw planks of timber transformed into functional, beautiful clocks. We also did some final housekeeping like a thorough workshop cleanup and reflecting on how the skills learned might connect to future projects or even careers. In short, Week 15 was all about closure and celebration.</p>
<h4>Final Checklist and Hand-In</h4>
<p>The first part of the week was making sure every student was ready to <strong>submit their project</strong>. We went through a final checklist as a class. Did your clock have all its parts (drawer fitted, backing attached, clock mechanism if applicable)? Did you remember to put your <strong>name or ID</strong> on or inside the clock? Many of you crafted a small name tag or wrote lightly in pencil on an inconspicuous spot – this helps ensure your clock can be identified during marking and returned to the right person. We also checked the <strong>folio (workbook)</strong> one last time: it should include your initial design sketch, the cutting list and costing exercise, all the weekly theory exercises or questions, your SWMS, and the self-evaluation you completed in Week 13. If anything was missing, this was the last chance to add it. A few students printed an extra photo of their clock to include in the folio, which was a nice touch!</p>
<p>Hand-in day itself was exciting. Each of you brought your finished clock to the front, along with your folio. There’s something very gratifying about placing a finished piece of work on the table – it’s heavier than paper, and you can literally see the effort that went into it. As the teacher, I carefully collected each project and workbook. We had a simple labeling system to keep clocks and folios paired (like matching numbers). Everyone met the deadline, which was fantastic – it shows good project management on your part. We snapped a quick group photo with all the clocks; it was great to visually take in the whole class’s achievements at once.</p>
<h4>Reflecting on Skills and Knowledge Gained</h4>
<p>With the pressure of due dates behind us, we spent a little time talking about the <strong>big-picture takeaways</strong> from this project. We revisited the syllabus outcomes we’ve been meeting: things like using tools safely (you all certainly did, with many of you now quite confident with saws and drills), applying design principles (each clock had the same basic plan but slight design variations, showing creative thinking), and using materials wisely (from understanding why pine was used, to how moisture affects wood, to calculating costs and minimising waste). We also mentioned the <strong>transferable skills</strong> you’ve developed. For instance, measuring and planning are useful in any DIY project. Knowing how to manage a project timeline (you had to do certain steps by certain weeks) is a skill that applies to lots of tasks, not just woodwork. And of course, the safety consciousness you’ve built – that awareness will be valuable whether you’re in a workshop, a science lab, or even just doing chores at home.</p>
<p>Some of you shared what you enjoyed most or what you found the hardest. A common sentiment was that seeing the final product made all the challenges worth it. Remember back in Week 1, the idea of making a clock from scratch might have felt intimidating. Now you can look at your clock and say, “I made this,” which is a huge confidence booster. We also touched on how technology and society connect – for example, we used mostly hand tools and simple power tools for this project, but imagine doing this in a factory: they’d use CNC machines, lasers, etc. Understanding the basics by hand gives you an appreciation for those advanced technologies (and perhaps some of you might be inspired to explore them in future courses).</p>
<h4>Cleanup and Celebration</h4>
<p>No project is truly complete until the workspace is clean! So we did a final <strong>workshop cleanup</strong>. We stored leftover timber pieces, cleaned and returned all tools to their proper places, and swept the floors. It was much quicker than our mid-project cleanups, partly because everyone was in a good mood and keen to finish, and partly because we’ve been keeping the place tidy as we went. Once the room was spick-and-span, we took a moment to acknowledge the journey. I congratulated the class on their hard work and improvement – comparing the rough cutting boards (breadboards) you made at the start of the year to these clocks shows a real progression in skill and complexity. Some of you who struggled with accuracy back then have clocks now with tight joints and smooth finishes. That’s real progress!</p>
<p>We ended the week (and the unit) with a little <strong>celebration</strong>. It could be as simple as a round of applause for each student, or in our case, we had a brief “show and tell” where each of you pointed out one feature of your clock you’re proud of or told a quick story (like “this dent on the back taught me why we use a backing board when drilling!” – got a laugh and a nod from everyone). It was a light-hearted end to a rigorous project. With projects handed in and the unit concluded, you’re now ready to enjoy a break or move on to the next challenge in our curriculum. But you’ll always have this clock – a tangible reminder of your hard work and the skills you’ve gained in Year 9 Industrial Tech Timber.</p>
<h4>Discussion Questions</h4>
<ol>
<li>Looking at your finished clock, what part of it are you the most proud of and why?</li>
<li>What was one of the biggest challenges you faced during this project, and how did you overcome it?</li>
<li>How do you think the skills you learned in this project (planning, using tools, finishing, etc.) could be useful in future projects or everyday life?</li>
<li>Why is it important to label your project and organise your folio before handing them in?</li>
<li>Now that the project is complete, is there anything you would tell your “Week 1 self” to do differently or pay special attention to?</li>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Week 15 brought our clock project adventure to a satisfying close. By handing in your completed clock and folio, you not only met the requirements of the course – you also got to experience the full arc of a project from conception to completion. This final week reinforced the importance of organisation (making sure everything was labeled and included), responsibility (meeting deadlines and cleaning up), and reflection (understanding what you’ve learned and how you’ve grown). Looking at all the finished clocks together, it’s clear that each one carries the imprint of its maker – a bit of creativity, a few learning scars (tiny mistakes turned into lessons), and a lot of hard work. You should be proud of your clock and of the skills you’ve developed along the way.</p>
<p>Remember that the end of a project is not the end of learning. The knowledge about timber, tools, and safety you’ve gained will stick with you. The ability to plan a project and see it through is something that will serve you well in many areas, not just in woodworking. And who knows – maybe this won’t be your last woodworking project. Whether or not you pursue more in this field, you’ve proven that you can turn an idea into a real, tangible object. That’s a big deal! As you move on, take a moment to congratulate yourself. From a rough plank to a finished clock, you’ve come a long way. This wrap-up isn’t just about ending a unit; it’s about recognising an achievement. Well done, and thanks for putting your heart into the project. Every time you cheque the time on your clock at home, you’ll be reminded of what you accomplished in Year 9 Industrial Tech Timber.</p>
