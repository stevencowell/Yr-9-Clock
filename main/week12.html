<summary><strong>Week 12: Sanding &amp; Surface Prep for Finishing</strong></summary>
<article>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>In Week 12, the focus shifted from construction to <strong>preparing</strong> your clock for a great finish. Now that the clock is fully assembled, it’s time to make its surfaces smooth and ready for oiling or varnishing. This week was all about <em>sanding</em> and surface preparation. You might think sanding is boring, but it’s a crucial step that can make the difference between a rough-looking project and a professional-looking one. By the end of the week, you had removed pencil marks and rough patches, eased any sharp edges, and learned why putting in the effort now will pay off when we apply the finish. In short, we turned our attention to all those little details that ensure the clock not only looks good but will also take a finish evenly.</p>

<h4>Why Sanding Matters</h4>
<p>We began by discussing <strong>why we sand</strong> at all. Sanding is about creating a smooth, even surface so that when we put a finish on the wood, it adheres well and looks great. Any roughness, tear-out, or pencil mark left on the wood will stand out even more after finishing. By sanding properly, we’re improving both the appearance and the longevity of the clock. A smooth surface takes oil or varnish evenly, which means the colour and sheen will be consistent. Skipping or rushing this step could lead to blotchy finish or rough texture. We also noted that sanding slightly rounds over (or <em>eases</em>) sharp edges. This is intentional: sharp corners don’t hold finishes well and are more prone to chipping. By easing edges, we make the clock nicer to touch and reduce the chance of the finish flaking off edges.</p>
<h4>Sanding Techniques and Grits</h4>
<p>Next, we dove into proper <strong>sanding techniques</strong>. We talked about sanding “with the grain” – moving your sandpaper in the same direction as the wood grain – to avoid scratching the wood. Sanding against the grain or in circles can leave noticeable scratch marks that only show up after finishing. In class, you started with a medium grit (like 120) sandpaper and worked your way to finer grits (like 180 and then 240). Using multiple grits in sequence is important: a coarse grit takes off material quickly but leaves scratches, and the next finer grit removes those scratches, and so on. If you jumped straight to a super fine grit, you’d waste time and still have rough patches from earlier cuts or dents. We also learned not to over-sand beyond what’s needed – for most finishes, sanding up to around 180 or 240 grit is enough. Sanding much further (like to 400+) can close up the wood’s pores so much that oil might not soak in as well. Everyone practiced using a sanding block to keep the sandpaper flat against the wood. This helps avoid sanding dips into your clock’s flat surfaces. For parts with curves or tight spots, some of you used a piece of sandpaper wrapped around a dowel or your finger to get into grooves. The room was a dusty mess by the end of the session, but your clock surfaces were feeling noticeably smoother!</p>
<h4>Cleaning Up for a Perfect Finish</h4>
<p>After sanding, we made sure to <strong>clean the wood</strong> thoroughly. This step is easy to overlook but very important. All the fine dust sitting on your clock can interfere with the finish – if you don’t remove it, you might end up with a gritty or cloudy coat of oil. As a class, we used soft brushes and rags to wipe every surface. Some of you used a slightly damp (not wet) cloth to pick up the remaining dust. We also blew dust out of crevices and checked inside the secret drawer compartment for stray sawdust. The goal was to have a dust-free clock, so that when we start oiling in Week 13, nothing unwanted gets trapped in the finish. We talked about how professionals often use tack cloths (sticky cloths) or air compressors to ensure wood is perfectly clean before finishing. We also reminded ourselves to clean the sanding equipment and our work area – piles of fine dust can be a hazard (slippery floors, or even a fire risk if near open flames or sparks). By the end of this cleanup, our clocks were smooth, clean, and ready for the first coat of oil.</p>
<h4>Ready for Finishing</h4>
<p>This week’s activities really emphasised the mantra “the better the prep, the better the result.” It might have been tempting to rush through sanding to get to the exciting part of applying finish, but now you see why patience here is essential. A few of you discovered small dents or tool marks in your clock that you hadn’t noticed before – and you were able to sand them out now, rather than be disappointed by them later. We also discussed how different grit levels remove material: starting with a coarse grit (if your wood had saw marks or rough spots from cutting) and finishing with fine grit for smoothness. If you ever work on a larger project (like a piece of furniture), the same rules apply: prepare the surface diligently. One student asked, “How smooth is smooth enough?” – generally, when it feels like glass under your fingertips and you can’t see scratches, you’re good to go. By the close of Week 12, you turned your attention to the upcoming finishing step, knowing that you’ve set yourself up for success by giving your clock the best surface possible.</p>
<h4>Discussion Questions</h4>
<ol>
<li>Why is it important to sand wood in the direction of the grain rather than against it?</li>
<li>We used several sandpaper grits (for example, 120 then 180 then 240). What is the reason for not just using a single “extra-fine” grit from the start?</li>
<li>What could happen if you forget to wipe off all the dust before applying an oil finish?</li>
<li>Why did we slightly round or ease the sharp edges of the clock during sanding?</li>
<li>If you notice a small dent or pencil mark on your clock while sanding, why is it better to fix it now rather than hope the finish will cover it up?</li>

<p>True or False: If you sand wood to a very high grit (say 600 or 800), it can sometimes make it harder for oil finishes to penetrate the wood. <button aria-label="Read question aloud" onclick="event.preventDefault(); speakText(this)" type="button">🔊</button></p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>By the end of Week 12, you transformed your clock from “freshly built” to “finish-ready.” You experienced first-hand why woodworkers say, “the finish is only as good as the prep work.” All the patience you put into sanding will make the next steps much more rewarding. The wood now feels silky to touch, edges are comfortable to hold, and the clock is clean of dust. You’ve set the stage for a beautiful finish. This week might not have involved dramatic changes to how the clock looks (sanding doesn’t always show until the finish goes on), but it was a great lesson in attention to detail. Just as a painter preps a canvas or a mechanic preps an engine, a good woodworker always prepares the timber. With your project prepped and ready, you can look forward to applying the oil finish next week and seeing the wood grain come alive, confident that it will turn out great thanks to your careful work now.</p>
