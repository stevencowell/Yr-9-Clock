<summary><strong>Week 6: Timber Seasoning &amp; Material Stability</strong></summary>
<article>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Week 6 shifted gears from hands-on building to understanding an important theory behind our material: timber seasoning. At this point, your clock carcass is assembled and we took a brief pause from construction to dive into *why* the wood behaves the way it does. You watched a documentary segment on how timber is seasoned (dried) and completed an exercise about moisture content and wood stability. The goal this week was to connect the quality of our timber to its preparation process. Properly seasoned wood is essential for a successful project – if we had used wet or “green” wood, our carefully made clock could warp or joints might loosen over time. Through video and discussion, you learned what happens to wood from the time it’s a freshly cut log to when it becomes the dry boards we’re using in class.</p>

<h4>Why Wood Needs Seasoning</h4>
<p><strong>Timber seasoning</strong> is the process of removing moisture from wood to prepare it for use. When wood is first cut from a tree (called <em>green timber</em>), it can contain a lot of water – often 50% or more of the wood’s weight is water. If you try to build with green timber, a few bad things can happen: as the wood dries out naturally, it will <strong>shrink</strong>, and it may <strong>warp</strong> (bend or twist) or <strong>crack</strong>. This could ruin the shape of your project or weaken the joints. Additionally, high moisture content makes wood susceptible to <strong>fungal attack</strong> (mould and rot love damp wood). By seasoning timber down to a suitable moisture level (for most indoor projects, around 10–15% moisture content), we ensure the wood is dimensionally stable and will remain strong and straight in the long term.</p>
<p>In class, we examined a cross-section of a tree and talked about where the water resides (in the cell cavities and cell walls of the wood). As wood dries, free water leaves first, then bound water in cell walls, causing the wood to shrink slightly. We discussed terms like <em>equilibrium moisture content (EMC)</em> – wood eventually dries to match the humidity of its environment. Timber used in New South Wales for indoor furniture is typically dried to around 12% EMC so that it won’t significantly swell or shrink in the average home environment. This week’s theory made it clear that the lumber we used for the clock had been properly seasoned, which is why your clock’s panels have stayed straight since Week 1!</p>
<h4>Methods of Seasoning: Air Drying vs Kiln Drying</h4>
<p>There are two primary methods to season timber: <strong>air drying</strong> and <strong>kiln drying</strong>. You learned about both through the documentary and our discussion afterward. In <em>air drying</em>, cut boards are stacked in the open air (but under cover, to avoid rain) with small sticks or spacers between them (these spacers are called stickers) to allow airflow. This method is slow – it can take many months or even years for thick wood to dry this way – but it’s energy-efficient and gentle. We saw images of timber yards with long stacks of wood drying naturally. Air-dried wood often ends up around 12–18% moisture content, depending on climate and storage, which can be fine for outdoor use or initial drying before kiln.</p>
<p><em>Kiln drying</em> is a faster, more controlled process. A kiln is like a big oven for wood where temperature, humidity, and air circulation are carefully managed. Fresh wood can be dried to a desired moisture level in a matter of days or weeks in a kiln. The documentary showed how boards are loaded into a kiln chamber and dried using heat (and sometimes steam at intervals to prevent overly rapid drying that could cause cracks). Kiln drying can bring wood down to a lower moisture content (such as 8–12% easily) which is ideal for indoor furniture. The trade-off is that it requires energy and equipment. We also noted that kiln drying can kill any insects or larvae in the wood (a bonus for ensuring timber is pest-free).</p>
<p>We discussed the pros and cons: air drying costs less and uses no electricity, but you have less control and it takes a long time; kiln drying is efficient and precise, but expensive and can sometimes cause internal stresses if done too quickly. Modern lumber production often uses a combination: air dry for a while, then finish in a kiln. As a class, we related this back to our clock project by considering what would happen if our pine hadn’t been dried properly – the front panel with the clock face hole might warp and jam the mechanism, or the carefully fit back panel might no longer sit flush in its rebate if the wood shrank. This is why all commercial timber you buy for projects comes seasoned.</p>
<h4>Recognising Well-Seasoned Timber</h4>
<p>You also learned some practical ways to tell if wood is seasoned. One is by using a <strong>moisture meter</strong> – a tool that can be pressed against the wood to electronically measure its moisture content. (We didn’t have one to try, but we saw a demonstration on video.) Other clues include looking for signs of warping or checking (small end cracks) which might indicate uneven drying. Properly seasoned wood tends to feel lighter than green wood of the same size and often makes a clearer “knock” sound when you tap it, whereas green wood sounds dull. We also touched on the concept of <strong>timber conversion</strong> – how the log was cut (quarter-sawn vs plain-sawn) can affect how it moves when drying, but that’s a deeper topic.</p>
<p>As part of the exercise, you answered questions about why builders prefer seasoned timber and how environmental humidity can affect wood even after it’s seasoned. For instance, we asked: What might happen to a door made of solid wood if the house gets very humid in summer? (Answer: it might swell a bit and stick, because wood can still absorb moisture from the air.) The takeaway is that wood is an organic material that reacts to moisture – but by proper seasoning, we minimise those reactions. This knowledge will help you not just with this clock project, but any time you work with wood in the future, because you’ll know to consider moisture and stability in your designs.</p>

It outlines how properly seasoned wood is stronger, less likely to decay, and maintains its shape, summarising the key advantages we discussed in class.</p>
<h4>Discussion Questions</h4>
<ol>
<li>Why is it not a good idea to build a clock or piece of furniture out of wood that is freshly cut (green) from a tree?</li>
<li>Explain the difference between air drying and kiln drying wood. What are the benefits of each method?</li>
<li>How does humidity in the environment affect seasoned timber over time? Can wood still move after it’s been seasoned?</li>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>This week’s focus on timber seasoning gave you a deeper appreciation of the material you’re working with. You learned that the stability and quality of your clock owes a lot to the fact that the wood was properly dried before we ever cut into it. Understanding seasoning is essential for any woodworker: it explains why wood behaves the way it does over time. Now, when you see wooden furniture or handle materials for projects, you’ll be aware of the unseen preparation that makes those items durable. With this knowledge, you’re better equipped to choose and work with timber in the future. As we return to practical work, remember that using well-seasoned wood is one of the reasons our projects succeed. It’s one more piece of the puzzle in becoming a skilled woodworker – marrying theoretical knowledge with hands-on practise.</p>
