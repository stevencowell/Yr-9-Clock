<summary><strong>Week 14: Theory Test &amp; Unit Feedback</strong></summary>
<article>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>In Week 14, we paused practical work entirely to focus on <strong>assessment and feedback</strong>. This week featured a short <strong>theory test</strong> covering all the key knowledge you’ve gained throughout the term (both the earlier Breadboard project and the Clock project theory). After the test, we spent time reviewing tricky questions and then moved into giving and receiving feedback about the project. In essence, this week was about checking understanding and reflecting on the unit as a whole. It might sound a bit daunting to have a test, but it was also a chance to celebrate how much you’ve learned. And don’t forget – feedback time is where you get to share your thoughts and hear about your performance beyond just a grade.</p>
<h4>Reviewing What We’ve Learned</h4>
<p>When test day arrived, you were presented with a mix of multiple-choice and short-answer questions that spanned everything from workshop safety rules to timber properties to project planning. The test was designed to revisit major points: for example, identifying tools and their uses, knowing why seasoned timber is important, recalling the steps of the design process, understanding joinery terms like “rebate” or “dowel joint,” and safety concepts like the hierarchy of controls. While the test was being taken, the room was quiet with concentration (except for the sound of pencils on paper). It was a closed-book test, but you had your brain packed with a term’s worth of hands-on experience and theory lessons. After time was up, we swapped papers (or used a digital quiz review) and went through the answers together. This review was perhaps the most valuable part – for each question, we discussed why the correct answer was correct. If a lot of people missed a particular question, it sparked a class discussion. For instance, one question about timber seasoning stumped a few students, so we revisited why drying wood is important to prevent warping. The point was not to dwell on mistakes, but to clear up any misunderstandings while it was fresh.</p>
<h4>Learning from the Test</h4>
<p>We also talked about <strong>test-taking and learning</strong>. A test isn’t just about a score – it’s a learning tool. If you got something wrong, that’s actually useful: it shows an area you can improve or a concept to review. As a class, we treated the test results not as a final judgment, but as feedback. Many of you did quite well, which was a confidence boost – you really have absorbed a lot this term! For any questions you found challenging, the group discussion helped make those concepts clearer. For example, a question asking to choose the best joint type for a given scenario led to a lively explanation from one student about why a dado joint would be stronger than just butt gluing. In reviewing the WHS questions, you all could easily rattle off safety rules and symbols, showing that the practical emphasis on safety had stuck with you. This review process hopefully also gave you strategies for future tests: read questions carefully, eliminate obviously wrong answers in multiple-choice, and apply what you did in projects to theoretical questions (often your practical experience gives the clue to the right answer).</p>
<h4>Project Feedback and Reflection</h4>
<p>With the test out of the way, we shifted to the <strong>unit feedback session</strong>. First, you received feedback on your clock projects themselves. This was essentially an informal pre-marking review: I (the teacher) pointed out things in each clock that were well done – for example, neat joins, a well-fitted drawer, an exceptionally smooth finish – and also gently noted any areas that could be improved – maybe a slight gap in a joint or a small sanding scratch that was missed. This one-on-one or small group discussion was meant to help you see your work from a teacher’s perspective and understand the criteria of quality. It wasn’t about criticism; it was about learning what “quality craftsmanship” means in concrete terms.</p>
<p>Then we opened up the floor for <strong>student feedback on the unit</strong>. This is where you got to voice your opinions about the project and the coursework. We asked: “What did you enjoy most about the clock project?”, “What was the most valuable thing you learned?”, and “What could be improved for next year’s class?” It was great to hear your insights. Many of you said you loved the practical building time – no surprise there! Some enjoyed the design aspect, others found the theory on wood and tools really interesting once they saw it applied in real life. On the flip side, a couple of you suggested that the pacing could be improved – for example, spending a bit more time earlier on practicing measurements would have helped reduce mistakes. One student suggested adding a small group challenge, like a contest for the most creative clock design, to spice things up. All these comments were noted. As a teacher, I value this feedback hugely because it helps shape future classes to be even better. We also did a quick survey where you rated different parts of the unit (like the breadboard refresher vs. the clock project, the difficulty of the theory work, etc.). The consensus was that while the project had its tough moments, everyone felt they came away with stronger skills and knowledge.</p>
<h4>Wrapping Up Loose Ends</h4>
<p>By the end of Week 14, we made sure all students had completed their project folios (workbooks) and any remaining worksheets. Those who missed parts of the test or had outstanding folio sections got a chance to catch up. There was a sense of relief and accomplishment in the air – the heavy lifting of the term was done. All that remained was the final hand-in of projects and folios next week. We reminded everyone to double-cheque their folio against the checklist: it should include your design sketches, materials/cutting list, the SWMS, progress journal entries, evaluation, and any other assigned write-ups. We also reminded you to label your project with your name or a project number for submission, to avoid any mix-ups during marking. The class ended with a quick cleanup (exams generate scrap paper and we had some sawdust bunnies lurking under benches from last week’s sanding!). With a clean room and clear minds, you headed into the final week ready to celebrate finishing the project.</p>
<h4>Discussion Questions</h4>
<ol>
<li>What was one topic on the test that you felt confident about, and why do you think you knew it so well?</li>
<li>If you got a question wrong on the test, what can that teach you for next time or for future projects?</li>
<li>What part of the clock project are you most proud of, now that you’ve seen everyone’s work and gotten feedback?</li>
<li>Can you think of one suggestion to improve this project unit for future students? (For example, something that could be explained better or a different activity that could be added.)</li>
<li>Why is it important to complete and hand in your folio (workbook) along with the finished project?</li>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>By the end of Week 14, you experienced the more “academic” side of our practical course – being tested on knowledge and reflecting through feedback. Far from being a dull wrap-up, this week showed how much you’ve learned and gave you insight into your own work habits and understanding. The theory test confirmed that safety, tools, and processes that once were new to you are now part of your skill set. Going over the answers helped cement that knowledge and correct any last misconceptions. The feedback session for the project was a chance to celebrate your craftsmanship and acknowledge improvements: looking at your finished clock and hearing “Great job on X, and here’s how to make Y even better next time” is exactly how we grow as craftspeople. Importantly, hearing your voices in the unit feedback discussion ensures that this course keeps evolving – your experiences will help shape how future students tackle the clock project. Now all that remains is the final formal hand-in and knowing that you’ve completed something substantial. The class atmosphere was proud and reflective: you’ve gone from raw materials to a finished clock, and learned a lot of theory and practical lessons along the way. Give yourself a pat on the back – you’re almost at the finish line of this unit!</p>
